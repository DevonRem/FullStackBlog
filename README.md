# FullStackBlog
Full-stack blog web app using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.JS
Upon booting to the home page, users can see all of the blog posts stored in the server and
click on these posts for more information. Users can register an account and have that 
data stored in the MongoDB server with their password encrypted for safety. 
Upon logging in users can make posts that contain a title, summary, image, and content of the post.
When a post is made it takes the username of the user and sets that as the author of
the post in addition to the time the post was created. If the user's ID is the same as the
author ID of the post then the user can edit that post and all of the data from that post is
kept so the user does not need to retype or reupload anything.
